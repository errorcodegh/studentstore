			The SUBTOTAL function can perform calculations like COUNT, SUM, MAX, MIN, and more. What makes SUBTOTAL especially interesting and useful is that it automatically ignores items that are not visible in a filtered list or table. This makes it ideal for showing how many items are visible in a list, the subtotal of visible rows, etc. </td>

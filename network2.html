<h5>Resetting your network devices and network stack, as well as updating your drivers, should be the first line of troubleshooting anytime you<br> encounter a networking issue. Some people know this. However, many people are unaware that there is a proper order in which to reset your networking <br>devices, for them to synchronize quickly. Following is the fastest and easiest way to resolve most network problems, including, but not limited to<br> Wi-Fi and Ethernet disconnects, slowdowns, and errors, even if these issues are affecting only one computer on your network. To reset your <br>devices in the correct order:<br>

Shut down your computer by clicking Start > Power > Shut Down. Please note that using the power button on your machine is probably set to sleep the<br> computer, not to shut it down. For troubleshooting purposes, the computer must be shut down.
Locate your modem and note the lights on your modem when it is normal and ready. There may be a “Ready” or “Online” light. Taking a picture with a <br>phone is a good tactic so that you know when it’s ready to go.<br>
Trace the Ethernet cord (not the screw-in coaxial cable or the power cord, but the one with a clip) to the next device to determine if you have a <br>router.
Unplug the power cord (either from the back of the device or from the wall, whichever is more comfortable) from your modem, router, and any switches <br>or hubs, between your computer and the modem, as well as any wireless boosters or access points, and leave them all unplugged for now.<br>
Plug in your modem.<br>
Wait until your modem’s lights show normal operation again.<br>
Plug in your router, if you have one, and give it about five minutes to boot. Routers typically have no external means of telling if they are ready,<br> but they should be ready after a five-minute wait.
Plug in anything else between your computer and the modem.<br>
Power on your computer.<br>
Once your computer is booted back up, if it is not connected to the Internet, or is still having issues, you will want to reset its network stack.<br>
Please note that these commands affect all of your networking adapters, both physical and virtual, both used and unused, so you will see some errors <br>when running these commands, where the resets targeted adapters that are not being used. These errors are perfectly normal, and not a cause for <br>concern. Please complete each step, in order, even if you have done some of these previously, and even if you encounter errors.<br>

In the search box on the taskbar (click Start), type command prompt, right-click the command prompt result and then select Run as administrator and confirm.
<li>Type ipconfig /release and press Enter.</li>
<li>Type ipconfig /flushdns and press Enter.</li>
<li>Type ipconfig /renew and press Enter. (this will stall for a moment)</li>
<li>Type netsh int ip reset and press Enter. (don’t restart yet)</li>
<li>Type netsh winsock reset and press Enter.</li>
<li>Now restart your machine using Start > Power > Restart once more and test to see if the issue is resolved.</li>
